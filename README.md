Screen One
This is the opening screen when you first open the app.
You can scroll down to look and choose which article you would like to choose.
When you find one you would like to look at just tap it and it should bring you to the next screen.
Screen Two
This is the next screen that will come up when you choose an article, it will display the title, 
authors and an abstract if it available. There is a label with the authors email if it has been provided.
There is also the switch which should save the document to your favourites, but mine doesnâ€™t do anything just yet.
The View PDF Button brings us to safari and opens the full document for you to read.
The screen also displays the authors email if it is available.
